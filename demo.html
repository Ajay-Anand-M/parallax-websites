        <p>Crowned world champions at Russia 2018, France have a major challenge on their hands: to do what no other
            team has in the past 60 years and retain the FIFA World Cup™ Trophy.
            Since Brazil won back-to-back titles in 1958 and 1962, the defending champions have always come up short at
            the following tournament.
            “We’ve got a massive task in front of us,” said Guy Stephan, assistant coach to Didier Deschamps, summing up
            the scale of the job they face. As Benjamin Pavard told FIFA+, "France are the team that everyone wants to beat".

            <h3>France's World Cup history:</h3><br>

            Les Bleus had some significant highs as the 20th century drew to a close, mixed in with the odd low. The
            exciting team of the 1980s reached two semi-finals in a row, at Spain 1982 and Mexico. Then came notable
            absences at Italy 1990 and USA 1994, followed by the glory of 1998, with a Trophy won on home soil, sparking jubilant
            nationwide celebrations.
            There have been similar ups and downs since the turn of the millennium. After the group-phase elimination at
            Korea/Japan 2002 came the huge disappointment of a Final lost to Italy at Germany 2006, a match that will
            forever be remembered for Zinedine Zidane’s headbutt. Four years later, internal problems undermined
            France’s challenge in South Africa and led to a fractious first-round exit.
            Deschamps’ arrival in the dugout marked a change of fortunes. First there was a fine campaign at Brazil 2014
            and then a second world title at Russia 2018. The highlights of that unforgettable campaign were the
            thrilling 4-3 defeat of Jorge Sampaoli’s Argentina in the last 16 and the superb 4-2 win over Zlatko Dalic’s Croatia
            in the Final.

        <h2>Germany</h2>

    </div>
    <div class=para-1>
        <p>“You must be 11 friends.”
            This is what Sepp Herberger told the German national team ahead of the 1954 FIFA World Cup™ final against
            Hungary in Switzerland. Now a well-known saying in Germany, it could scarcely be more descriptive of the
            team’s achievements, and strikes at the very heart of German football: team spirit, fighting spirit and
            togetherness have characterised generations of players who have been extraordinarily successful in major
            competitions.
            The flip side of that coin, however, is that if the sense of harmony and atmosphere within the team is not
            right, things can become difficult. Russia 2018 was a case in point: struggling with national pressure and their
            own expectations, Germany produced their worst-ever World Cup performance and were eliminated at the group
            stage. The team’s quality, as well as their difficulties in finishing and maintaining their mentality throughout
            the 90 minutes was evident during Qatar 2022 qualifying and in the UEFA Nations League. That makes it all the more exciting to see whether Germany will transition into a tournament team – as is customary – or whether they
            will fail to live up to their own expectations.

            <h3>Germany’s World Cup record :</h3><br>

            Germany’s relationship with the World Cup is one of a few lows but even higher highs, bringing out intense
            emotions for everyone involved. After Brazil, Germany are the most successful country in the competition’s history,
            having won the title four times in 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014, as well as finishing as runners-up on four occasions
            (1966, 1982, 1986, 2002) and ending in third place three times. It is therefore not surprising that some of the
            most successful strikers in World Cup history are from Germany: Miroslav Klose (16 goals) and Gerd Muller (13)
            both achieved legend status with their World Cup performances.

        <h2>Argentina </h2>

    <div class=para-2>
        <p>Argentina will head to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ with expectations at their highest in years.
            The 2021 Copa America win, secured on Brazilian soil at the Estadio Maracana, fired the dreams of a country
            that has but one objective on its mind: lifting a third World Cup Trophy. With Lionel Messi still leading the way
            in what will be his fifth and, quite possibly, last world finals appearance, there are many reasons why La
            Albiceleste are contenders for the most prized piece of silverware in the game.Qualification turned out to be the most
            straightforward of tasks for Lionel Scaloni’s side, who continue to surprise. In winning 11 matches and drawing six, they collected 39 points to finish second only to Brazil
            and 11 points clear of third. Impressive as those statistics are, it was the manner in which those points were won
            and the continental title claimed last year that has the Argentinians dreaming once more of World Cup glory. Following the defeat to France at Russia 2018 and the departure of a breed that had come so close to making football history at Brazil 2014, the outlook looked gloomy for La Albiceleste. Not only were there doubts
            about the potential of the new generation of players that came into replace them, but several well-known coaches
            turned down the opportunity to take on such a high-pressure job. Claudio Tapia, the president of the Argentinian Football Association (AFA), eventually put his faith in the untested Lionel Scaloni, who had joined the coaching staff of previous incumbent Jorge Sampaoli in 2018. It
            has turned out to be an inspired choice. Four years on, Scaloni will take his team to Qatar with spirits high
            having put the disappointments of recent years behind them and overcome a psychological barrier in the process. With a settled line-up, the eternal leadership of Messi, a new breed that can do justice to the jersey, and Scaloni’s tactical acumen, Argentina have their sights set on World Cup number three.

            <h3>Argentina's World Cup history:</h3><br>

            Argentina head to Qatar determined to atone for a somewhat chaotic campaign at Russia 2018. A painful defeat
            to Croatia in the group phase left them with a daunting last-16 tie against France, who edged a thrilling game
            4-3 and went on to win the title. That frustrating defeat was one of several the South Americans have endured in
            recent years. None were more agonising than the extra-time Final loss to Germany at Brazil 2014 or the penalty-shootout
            reverse inflicted by the same opponents in the quarter-finals at Germany 2006, a match the Argentinians looked to
            have won in normal time. Argentina and Messi will keep on trying. In what may well be his last world finals, La Pulga will attempt to emulate Diego Armando Maradona’s achievements at Mexico 1986, whose exploits against England in the last
            eight of that competition are remembered by every Argentinian. La Albiceleste went on to win their second World Cup
            that year, the first having come on home soil in 1978.

    <div class=spain>
        <h2>Spain</h2>

    </div>
    <div class=para-1>
        <p>The sun is shining again for a team with renewed belief. After two FIFA World Cup™ cycles that served up more
            than their fair share of frustration, controversy and disappointment, Luis Enrique has got Spain back on
            track as they bid to bring back the glory years of 2008 to 2012.
            After promising performances at the three continental tournaments they have appeared in since their last-16
            elimination at Russia 2018, La Roja are hoping to figure strongly again at Qatar 2022. Though many are
            resisting the urge to bracket them among the main contenders, the men in red are intent on lifting the
            Trophy again and have some very good reasons for setting their objectives so high.
            Their qualification campaign began in less than auspicious style. Struggling to impose themselves on their
            group opponents, Luis Enrique’s side drew with Greece in their opening match, needed a very late goal to see off
            Georgia, and then lost away to Sweden. A surprise defeat for the Swedes away to Georgia opened the door for the
            Spanish, however, and when the top two met in Seville on the final matchday, Spain struck four minutes from time to
            secure a narrow win and a direct ticket to Qatar. It was a happy end to a challenging campaign in which Ferran Torres top-scored with four goals and Luis
            Enrique continued to shape and polish his young side.

            <h3>Spain's World Cup history:</h3><br>

            Spain have scaled the heights and plumbed the depths over the last 12 years. After many years of
            frustration, a team low on furia but high on football won the country’s first world title at South Africa 2010. That
            legendary side, which had already won one European crown and would defend it successfully in 2012, recovered from a
            surprise defeat to Switzerland in their opening match to win the Trophy for a nation that lives and breathes
            football. Spain’s future seemed bright, only for the clouds to gather immediately. Their ill-fated title defence at
            Brazil 2014 began with a heavy loss to a Netherlands side anxious to avenge their defeat in the Final four years
            earlier. The end of a golden era, it was also the end of the road for several of the players who made it happen. Julen Lopetegui came in to oversee the transition and rebuild confidence only to be dismissed from the post
            on the eve of Spain’s opening match at Russia 2018. Amid the turmoil, Fernando Hierro was hastily appointed as
            caretaker but was powerless to prevent La Roja from tumbling out of the competition in the last 16, victims of the
            host nation in a penalty shootout. Having subsequently impressed in the UEFA Nations League and EURO 2020, Spain
            have regained their poise.

    <div class=brazil>
        <h2>Brazil</h2>

    </div>
    <div class=para-1>
        <p>
            FIFA/Coca-Cola Ranking leaders Brazil will be taking a much-changed line-up to the FIFA World Cup Qatar
            2022™, with more than half the squad that fell to Belgium in the last eight in Russia four years having been
            replaced.
            Aside from a change in personnel, there has also be a shift in the Seleção mindset. This is a more
            adventurous side that has harnessed the flair and attacking skills of a clutch of exciting young forwards
            who left Brazil at a young age and have established themselves at some of Europe’s biggest clubs.
            They include Vinicius Junior, Antony, Raphinha and Rodrygo. Teenagers for the most part in 2018, when they
            were starting out on their careers, they are now ready to help Neymar shoulder the creative burden.
            “A Seleção had the results and the solidity but we lacked the impetuosity and creativity that these players
            bring,” said head coach Tite, who wasted little time in bringing the new generation into the fold. With so much
            talent at his disposal, he now has the difficult task of deciding who will make the trip to the World Cup and who will
            stay at home. His side have just put together the best ever campaign in the South American qualifiers, recording 14 wins,
            three draws and no defeats and scoring 40 goals in total and conceding just five. Their aim now is to go all the
            way in Qatar.
            <h3>Brazil's World Cup history:</h3><br>
            Though they have failed to reach the Final since making it five world titles at Korea/Japan 2002, and though Germany and Italy have closed the gap on them since then, A Seleção are still out on their own as the most successful nation in World Cup history.
             They have also reached the quarter-finals at every world finals since USA 1994.
        </p>

    <div class=portugal>
        <h2>Portugal</h2>

    </div>
    <div class=para-1>
        <p>Portugal have quality in every department and players who know what it means to win trophies on the
            international stage, namely UEFA EURO 2016 and the 2019 UEFA Nations League. It is for those reasons that
            they are capable of taking on and beating any side.
            Their confidence has just taken a dent, however, with Spain’s narrow 1-0 win at the end of the Nations
            League group phase reviving memories of painful slip-ups in the past. The setback even had some fans
            questioning the place of the legendary Cristiano Ronaldo.
            Portugal needed just a point from that match, played in Braga, to reach the semi-finals. With 87 minutes
            gone and the game still goalless, they looked on course to achieve it, only for Alvaro Morata to pop up with a late
            winner for the visitors. The denouement was reminiscent of the 2-1 home loss to Serbia in November 2021, on the
            final matchday of the qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™, a defeat that forced the Portuguese to
            negotiate the play-offs. The trip to Qatar will provide the team with a chance to make peace with the fans. Joining Ronaldo on the
            plane will be a compelling mix of players covering several generations. Now into their 30s, Joao Moutinho and
            Danilo are both in the old guard, while Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo are all 28, Ruben Dias is
            still only 25, and Joao Felix and Vitinha are three years younger. A long world-finals campaign would provide the perfect send-off for the veterans and also act as a
            springboard for the players who will take over from them and lead Portugal into the future.
            <h3>Portugal's World Cup history:</h3><br>

            Portugal’s best ever performance at the World Cup came at England 1966, when a Eusebio-inspired team placed
            third. The country’s next appearance did not come until Mexico 1986, which was followed by another lengthy absence,
            until Korea/Japan 2002. The Portuguese have been tournament ever-presents since then and reached the semi-finals
            for a second time at Germany 2006.
        </p>

    <div class=england>
        <h2>England</h2>

    </div>
    <div class=para-1>
        <p>
            Semi-finalists in 2018, runners-up at UEFA EURO 2020… can England continue that upwards trajectory by
            topping the podium at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™?
            They certainly have the talent, with Harry Kane – adidas Golden Boot winner at the last FIFA World Cup™ –
            heading up a squad of largely young, gifted and, crucially, tournament-hardened players.
            Further encouragement was gleaned from the Qatar 2022 qualifiers, as Gareth Southgate’s side emerged
            unbeaten from a section that included Poland and Hungary, scoring more goals (39) than any other European
            team. And while the EURO ended with another heart-breaking shootout defeat, the hugely impressive campaign
            that preceded those penalties – including wins over the likes of Croatia, Germany and Denmark – strengthened
            the Three Lions’ World Cup credentials.Doubts have been sown more recently though. A series of lacklustre
            performances this year – including a shock 4-0 home loss to the Hungarians – dented fans’ confidence and resulted in UEFA Nations League relegation. They
            have also left Southgate with plenty to ponder ahead of the big kick-off.
            <h3>England’s World Cup history:</h3><br>
            Finishing fourth at the last World Cup was England’s best showing since ending up with an identical ranking
            at Italia 90.
            The only time they have fared better, of course, was in 1966. That triumph on home soil remains the high
            point of the nation’s football history, with Sir Geoff Hurst still the only man in history to have scored a World Cup
            final hat-trick.
